<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>It is important in sports to gain insight and knowledge of the physical demands from training and matches to improve performance and prevent injuries. Some of the most frequently reported metrics in football are: distance covered, distance in velocity zones and number of acc- &amp; decelerations . These metrics are most commonly being measured with the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS), which have seen an exponentially growth in outdoor team-sports. GPS is validated for use in outdoor team sports with a sampling frequency of minimum 10 Hz . Furthermore,  also found that the reliability of the GPS was independent on the time of day. However, these metrics mostly focus on linear movements and does not take into account the load from small and energy demanding non-linear movements like change of directions, jumps or the amplitude of an acceleration or deceleration.</p>
<p>Football has over the last decade experienced an increase in the quantity of short bouts of activity, compared to total distance travelled  and some studies have shown upwards of eightfold more occurrences of accelerations than sprints . Accelerations also has a greater metabolic demand than steady state running , therefore a huge part of the physical demand is never accounted for with the use of the conventional metrics from GPS data. Therefore it is important for the practitioners to monitor the acc- &amp; decceleration profile of the players. However, GPS has shown poor validity with accelerations above <span class="math inline">\(4\: m\cdot s^{-2}\)</span> .</p>
<p>Another approach is to use Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), since these are now miniaturized and non obstructive. IMUs are experiencing an increase in popularity and have been successfully used in both outdoor and indoor team sports, to measure the physical demands . The IMUs in Catapult Sportsâ€™ tracking device, Minimax S4 and OptimEye S5, has shown to have an acceptable level of validity and reliability .
One of the most commonly used metrics in football from an IMU, is the magnitude of accelerations (square root of the summed squares of the three axis). The magnitude of acceleration is the instantaneous rate of change in acceleration across all three axis. This has been given names like <span class="math inline">\(PlayerLoad^{TM}\)</span> (Catapult Sports) and <span class="math inline">\(Body Load\)</span> (GPSports). Where <span class="math inline">\(PlayerLoad^{TM}\)</span> has shown acceptable reliability during Australian Football matches both within and between the used devices (MinimaxX 2.0, Catapult Sports) .</p>
<p>Based on the accelerometer data from the IMU, and therefore also the magnitude of accelerations,
Catapult Sports have developed a sport specific movement algorithm (Football Movement profile (FMP)). The FMP is an attempt to create a deeper insight into the demands of football. The algorithm classify movements in six categories depended on intensity and if it is a linear or a multi directional movement. By utilizing linear acceleration data, it is possible to get a deeper and more relevant insight into the loading characteristics in players, compared to linear velocity data. However, working with acceleration data can be cumbersome and the alternative would be to use motion capture analysis, but these are highly time-consuming . Therefore, by creating acceleration profiles, FMP, it is now easily accessible for the practitioners to use to monitor player demands in both training and matches. This is especially important for elite football teams who have the means to buy and utilize the collected data, as it assist in the insight of the individual player load. This also makes the data usable as the training or match is occurring, which would not be the case for a motion capture analysis approach. The FMP can therefore help the coaches make more informed decisions regarding the training load and also specify training drills to the requirements of a match.</p>
<p>However, this algorithm has never been properly validated. This questions both the validity and reliability of FMP. These aspect can be studied by studying both controlled and football specific drills and measure the inter-rater reliability. The controlled drills purpose would be to simplify movements down to each of the FMPs movement categories, to remove the human labelling procedure. Though, for the football specific drills a human labelling procedure would be needed as the algorithm needs to be compared to a trained raters judgement from motion capture analysis. Different trained raters may label the same event differently . Therefore, it is important to establish a base for which the FMP can be compared to, which can be accomplished by performing inter-reliability test between different raters before comparing it to the FMP.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was twofold. 1. To test the agreement between GPS data and the FMP for the controlled drills. 2. Test the inter-rate reliability between three trained raters and the FMP algorithm for the football specific drills.</p>

<div id="method" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Method</h1>
<p>41 elite youth football players from a Swedish approved elite sports high school participated in the study (36 males and 5 females, <span class="math inline">\(17.4 \pm 0.8\)</span> yrs old, <span class="math inline">\(180.1 \pm 7.6\)</span> cm, <span class="math inline">\(70.3 \pm 8.7\)</span> kg). All participants signed a participation consent form. Players that were below the age of 18 had a parent / legal guardian to sign the form. Each player wore a catapult vest with the Catapult Vector X7 device, on the back between the scapulae. The X7 contains an IMU and a GPS. The IMU consists of a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope with a range of <span class="math inline">\(\pm 16g\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2000^{\circ}/s\)</span> respectively, which collected data, at 1000Hz then downsampled to 100Hz before entering the proprietary software, Openfield (v XX, firmware vXX). A magnetometer was also part of the IMU (see figure @ref(fig:globalSystem) for the IMU orientation). The GPS collected data at 10hz and determines distance from positional differentiation and velocity from the Doppler shift technique.</p>

</div>
<p>Videos were recorded with a Canon VIXIA HF G50 4K camcorder at 50fps and a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. The camera was placed differently, depending on the drill that was executed. Details on this will follow in each respective section. To ensure synchronization between the IMUs and the cameras, all participants was instructed to stand still for a few seconds, then perform 3 jumps and subsequently stand still for a few seconds again before performing a drill. This was controlled for by the football instructor who also had the responsibility of teaching the athletes how to perform the different drills.</p>
<p>The players were divided into three groups (depended on their high school year). Two groups participated across two days. First day was outside on a football field, second day was inside a tent with a football field made from artificial grass. The last group only participated one day, inside the tent. The quality of the GPS data was still high during data collection inside the tent (&gt; 6 satellites, &lt; 1 HDOP)  with only very few critical samples, as can be seen in figure @ref(fig:gpsQuality).</p>

</div>
<p>The data collection consisted of two categories of drills. The controlled drills and the football specific drills. Each of these categories also have their own labeling and statistic procedure. Therefore, the method will be divided into two sections.</p>
<div id="controlled-drills" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Controlled drills</h2>
<p>The controlled drills consisted of subcategories; linear locomotion and non-linear locomotion drill.
The linear locomotion drills consisted of 5 different velocities; 5.4, 12, 18, 19.8 and 21.6 km/t. Velocities were controlled for, by the placement of cones on the football field and the players was instructed to pass the next cone at each sounding bip, which were repeated every 3 s from a loudspeaker (see figure @ref(fig:linearlocomotion)).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">(#fig:linearlocomotion)Practical setup for the linear locomotion data collection</p>
</div>
<p>The non-linear locomotion drill consisted of 3 different intensities. The players would run to the middle of a circle and then out to the cones that was placed at the circles edge all the way around the circle: For the lowest intensity players were instructed to pass the next cone at the sounding of a bip that were repeated every 3 s from a loudspeaker. Second iteration they were instructed to perform it as quick as possible. The third iteration they would again do it as quick as possible, but only for half the circle before they were done (see figure @ref(fig:nonlinear)).</p>
